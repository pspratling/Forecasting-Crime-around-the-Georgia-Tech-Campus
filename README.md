An end-to-end project of forecasting crimes on and around the Georgia Tech Campus

In this notebook I merge Georgia Tech crime logs, Atlanta demographics statistics, and Georgia Tech enrollment data. I also clean the merged data into a tidy form ready for analysis.

In this notebook, I take the data I merged and cleaned in the Data Wrangling notebook, and use it to tell a story about crime levels on and around the Georgia Tech campus. How have overall crime levels changed over the years? Which types of crime are more likely on certain locations of campus? During certain times of day or year? These are just a few of the questions I look to answer in this notebook with the goal of using these insights to improve the final forecasts of number of crimes.

In this notebook, I take the data I cleaned and analyzed in the previous notebooks and use it to make my final regression models that forecast number of crimes in a given month in and around the Georgia Tech campus.
